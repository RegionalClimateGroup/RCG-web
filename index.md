## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RegionalClimateGroup/rcg.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### About the Regional Climate Group

The Regional Climate Group (RCG) studies climate at regional-to-global scales. Our research is based on instrumental data, outputs from Global/Regional Climate Models and paleoclimate proxy records.

RCG has a unique profile combining modern- and paleo-climate studies within the Swedish climate research community and an international reputation in the fields of regional climate dynamics and climate change. RCG represents a successful research environment, with a high scientific production rate, close connections with international and national research communities, modern climate research tools and GIS competences.

Major research topics:

- Climate system dynamics with a focus on climate changes in Eurasia
- Paleo-hydroclimate reconstructions and climate change impacts
- Ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions
- Statistical and dynamical downscaling
