#The Regional Climate Group 

The Regional Climate Group(RCG) studies climate at regional-to-global scales. Our research is based on instrumental data, outputs from Global/Regional Climate Models and paleoclimate proxy records.

RCG has a unique profile combining modern- and paleo-climate studies within the Swedish climate research community and an international reputation in the fields of regional climate dynamics and climate change. RCG represents a successful research environment, with a high scientific production rate, close connections with international and national research communities, modern climate research tools and GIS competences.

Major research topics:

    Climate system dynamics with a focus on climate changes in Eurasia
    Paleo-hydroclimate reconstructions and climate change impacts
    Ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions
    Statistical and dynamical downscaling
